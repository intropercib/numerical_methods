## Introduction

This repository aims to be a learning and reference guide for various **numerical methods** used in computational mathematics and engineering. It contains a mix of theoretical explanations, practical implementations, and hands-on examples.

### What are Numerical Methods?

- Numerical methods are algorithms used to solve mathematical problems numerically (i.e., with approximations), often involving computational tools.
- They are used in fields like **engineering**, **data science**, **physics**, **finance**, and **machine learning**.
- Numerical methods include techniques for solving equations, finding roots, integration, differentiation, interpolation, and more.

### Why Learn Numerical Methods?

- **Accuracy**: Numerical methods can provide accurate solutions to complex mathematical problems.
- **Efficiency**: They can solve problems that are intractable by analytical methods.
- **Widespread Use**: Numerical methods are used in many fields, from engineering to finance.
- **Computational Thinking**: They help develop your problem-solving and computational thinking skills.
